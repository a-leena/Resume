    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am inclined towards Data Science,
        Machine Learning and Image
        Processing, and I'm currently on the
        path to exploring and learning more
        in those areas. I'm a team player
        since I quite enjoy the interaction,
        and also find group projects as a
        great way of improving practical
        skills and for broadening my
        understanding of the domain.
